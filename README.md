# matlabPressureAnalysis
Matlab application for visualizing and extracting data exported from Footscan

Files include \*.mlapp file, which is a GUI-based program written for matlab 2018, which loads pressure mat data and visualizes it so that values such as foot area/average pressure can be extracted for any given footfall.

Buggy as heck and feature incomplete at the moment!

Repository also includes a sample dataset of a goat walking over the pressure mat.
